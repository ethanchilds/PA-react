# Overview

This software was created with the intention of creating a basic pregnancy app. When this project was first imagined, one of our group members was pregnant and we decided collectively that we would create a pregnancy app that she would want to use. With that in mind we went out and created this app within a react native architecture. This has not been launched to any stores, so in order to use it download the Expo Go app, in terminal use the command "npm start", and then scan the QR code that will appear in terminal. 

The main components of this app are a daily water intake tracker, an expected due date countdown, and a section for listing out possible baby names. These features can be seen and used by interacting with a task bar at the bottom of the app.

# Future Work

* By the time we had reached the deadline we had placed on ourselves for this project, we had actually completed all base goals that we planned for this project. However, while we did complete these goals, we didn't get to integrate everything piece as planned. The main pieces that exist within our app repository but are currently not an integrated part of the app itself are the countdown tracker, the user login and account creation screens, and our back end. To improve this project in the future we plan to incorporate these different screens into the UI and make use of the backend routes to incorporate data storage into this app.
* Going into this project we had planned for a little bit more stylization in hopes of creating an app that could actually be launched, however, in favor of completing the functional parts of this software we abandonded this goal for a later date. In the future we would like to finally complete our app stylization.
* As previously stated, we had at one point been thinking about actually publishing this app to the apple and google app stores. We would still like to complete this task. Obviously this would be our last goal after we have totally completed and validated our app, but it is still something we would like to eventually do.
